# Next.js 15: Async/Await in useEffect with Server Components - Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 involving the use of `async/await` within a `useEffect` hook in a client component that interacts with server components.  The problem arises from the client component attempting to access data from a server action before it has fully resolved.

## Problem Description

The client component fetches data using a server action. The `useEffect` hook is used to run the server action, but it's possible for the `await` operation to be called before the server action completes. This could lead to undefined data being used, causing unexpected behavior.  The issue is subtle because there might not be explicit error messages; instead, components may render incorrectly, or data updates may be delayed or missed.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the server action completes successfully before attempting to access its results within the client component.  This can be achieved using proper error handling and a loading state to manage asynchronous operations gracefully.

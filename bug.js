In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with `async/await` within a `useEffect` hook inside a client component.  The issue stems from the client component attempting to await a server action that hasn't fully resolved, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.  This often manifests as data not updating correctly or components not rendering as expected.
